# Sentsation
__sentsation__ is a Python module for multimodal sentiment/emotion analysis.

The project was started as a capstone project for Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. It will be under continuous development, and by no mean a mature module at current stage (in other words, use at your own risk :P).  

## Prerequisites  
The module was built on Python 3.6  
If you need to use the video-to-audio conversion function, here is the dependency:
* ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org) 

## Installation
Method 1: Install __sentsation__ from the GitHub source  
 First, clone the repo using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeetaros/sentsation.git
```

 Then, `cd` to the repo folder and install via `pip`:
```sh
